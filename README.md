Hi I'm Brunno! A systems analysis and development student in Brazil.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying systems analysis and development UCB

ðŸ”­ I am looking for my first job opportunity, and more than that, I seek a chance to enhance my knowledge, grow professionally, and become an active member of the GitHub programming community. 

âš¡ I am highly interested in exchanging experiences, sharing ideas, and continuously learning from other developers, while actively contributing to projects and the collective growth of the community.
